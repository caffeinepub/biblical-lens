# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the results display bug and implement an inline results section on the same page.

**Planned changes:**
- Fix bug preventing analysis results from displaying after API call completes
- Display results section on the same page below the "Analyze Content" button with smooth slide-down animation
- Show a large colored circle (green, yellow, or red) at the top of results based on rating
- Display explanation text in a card below the colored circle
- Display Bible verse reference and full verse text in a highlighted box (from Claude API response)
- Add a "Try Another" button that clears both input field and results for a fresh start

**User-visible outcome:** After clicking "Analyze Content", users will see their analysis results slide down on the same page, displaying a color-coded rating circle, explanation, Bible verse, and the ability to start fresh with a "Try Another" button.
